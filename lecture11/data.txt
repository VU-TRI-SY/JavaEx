In ancient history books, some philosophers wrote about the existence of a 
continent with a very advanced and developed city that once ruled the world, 
the city of Atlantis. The Greek philosopher Plato mentioned it in two topics. 
He said that Toulon went on a trip to the priests of Egypt and they told him 
about an Atlantic continent that ruled the world and provided scientific 
development, especially in the field of shipbuilding and learning.
